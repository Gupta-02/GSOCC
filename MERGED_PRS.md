### [#203 moved internal css into external css for games](https://github.com/VAIBHAVBABELE/vaibhavbabele.github.io/pull/203)

- **Author:** [@Shivani-pandey04](https://github.com/Shivani-pandey04)
- **Description:**  
Moved internal CSS from gamess.html and all the games into a separate external CSS files

📄 Description:
Due to styling conflicts and structural issues when combining all CSS into a single file (gamess.css), I created a separate CSS file (gamecard.css) specifically for game card styles. This improves modularity, avoids unintended overrides, and makes the styles easier to maintain.

Additionally, I deleted the previously separate game-specific CSS files (memory.css, quiz.css, etc.) after merging relevant styles into the unified file.

UI/UX Update 🎨

🧑‍💻 What changes were made?
Moved internal CSS code from hangman.html to game_card.css
Moved internal CSS code from quiz.html to game_card.css
Moved internal CSS code from typing.html to game_card.css
Moved internal CSS code from memory.html to game_card.css
Linked external CSS files properly in the HTML head tags

📚 Documentation Updated?
 Yes, I have updated the relevant section in README.md or related files.

### [#180 feat: Implement comprehensive security improvements for Nitra Mitra platform](https://github.com/VAIBHAVBABELE/vaibhavbabele.github.io/pull/180)

- **Author:** [@singharyan006](https://github.com/singharyan006)
- **Description:**  
# 🔖 feat: Implement comprehensive security improvements for Nitra Mitra platform

---

## 📄 Description:

- [x] Bug Fix ✅
- [x] New Feature ✨
- [x] Enhancement 🔧
- [x] Documentation 📝

This PR implements comprehensive security enhancements for the Nitra Mitra educational platform, addressing multiple web security vulnerabilities while maintaining all existing functionality.

---

## 🧑‍💻 What changes were made?

- 🛡️ **Added comprehensive security headers** (CSP, XSS protection, clickjacking prevention, HSTS)
- 🔐 **Implemented SRI hashes** for all external CSS/JS resources to prevent CDN tampering
- ⚙️ **Created centralized configuration system** replacing hardcoded API keys and settings
- 📦 **Built dynamic analytics loader** with error handling and fallback mechanisms
- 🔒 **Enhanced server security** with sensitive file protection and server signature hiding
- 📚 **Added complete documentation** with security implementation details

---

## 📚 Documentation Updated?
- [x] Yes, I have updated the relevant section in `README.md` or related files.

**New Documentation Added:**
- `SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Comprehensive guide covering all security enhancements

---

**Browser Developer Tools showing new security headers:**
- Content-Security-Policy ✅
- X-Frame-Options ✅  
- X-Content-Type-Options ✅
- Strict-Transport-Security ✅
- X-XSS-Protection ✅

---

## 💡 Tech Stack Used:
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript ✅
- **Other:** Apache .htaccess configuration, Security Headers, SRI (Subresource Integrity)

---

## List of File Changed :

**# no. of file changed: 6**

1. `assistant.html` - Added SRI hashes, removed hardcoded analytics, integrated configuration system
2. `.htaccess` - Added comprehensive security headers and server protection
3. `js/config.js` - **NEW FILE** - Centralized configuration management system
4. `js/analytics.js` - **NEW FILE** - Dynamic analytics and ads loader with error handling
5. `.htaccess.backup` - **NEW FILE** - Safety backup of original server configuration  
6. `SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - **NEW FILE** - Complete documentation

---

## 🔗 Issue Reference:
Closes #145  

---

## 🙏 Additional Info (if any):

### 🔒 **Security Vulnerabilities Addressed:**
- **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy + SRI hashes prevent script injection
- **Clickjacking Prevention**: X-Frame-Options blocks malicious iframe embedding  
- **MIME Confusion**: X-Content-Type-Options prevents browser misinterpretation
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: HSTS with preload forces secure connections
- **Privacy Protection**: Referrer policy controls information leakage

### 📊 **Impact Assessment:**
- **✅ Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- **✅ Performance Maintained**: No degradation in page load times
- **✅ Analytics Working**: Google Analytics and AdSense continue functioning

### 🧪 **Testing Completed:**
- Security headers verified in browser developer tools
- SRI hashes validated for all external resources  
- Analytics initialization tested and working
- Error handling tested for failed resource loads

**This implementation follows industry best practices while maintaining the original user experience and significantly improving the platform's security posture.** 🚀

- **Description:**  
🔖 PR Title:
Enhance Feedback Form Validation with Robust JavaScript Checks

�� Description:
<!-- Describe in detail what you changed or added -->
Improved the frontend validation logic for the Feedback Form in index.html.

Ensured that the email field enforces a standard email format, not just presence of '@'.

Made sure that "Name" and "College" fields only accept alphabets, spaces, and hyphens (no numbers or unrelated special characters).

Provided clear, user-friendly inline error messages above the form, blocking submission if validation fails.

🧑‍💻 What changes were made?
<!-- Bullet points of major changes -->
Added a new JavaScript block at the end of index.html to handle custom form validation logic.

Implemented validators for email, name, and college fields.

Modified the form submit event to prevent invalid submissions and display inline errors.

No server-side/backend logic was changed; all changes pertain to client-side validation.

📚 Documentation Updated?
 Yes, I have updated the relevant section in README.md or related files.

 No, documentation was not required for this change.

 Not yet, I will do it soon.

## 🔖 PR Title:

Improved alt tag for Games card and resource card image
## 📄 Description:
<!-- Describe in detail what you changed or added -->
This PR focuses on improving the accessibility and SEO of the Nitra Mitra homepage.
Specifically, I have refined the 'alt' attributes for the following images in `index.html`:
- The image for the "Resources" card: changed `alt="..."` to `alt="Illustration representing academic resources"`.
- The image for the "Games" card: changed `alt="..."` to `alt="Game section"`.

This ensures screen readers provide more meaningful context and helps with image search indexing.

🔠 Typing Speed Challenge – Improve typing speed with a live word-per-minute counter.

🧩 Coding Quiz – A quick, beginner-friendly coding quiz with MCQs.

💀 Hangman (CS Edition) – Guess computer science-related terms in a classic hangman format.

it is a bug fix, feature enhancement and ui enhancement.

- Fixed the broken routing issue where the /games route previously returned a 404 error.
- Set up proper navigation from the home page to games page.
- Applied consistent Bootstrap-based styling to ensure all game pages match the overall design.
- Cleaned up component structure and file organization for easy scalability and maintainability.
- Implemented four games with individual pages and internal logic:

<body>
<!--StartFragment--><html><head></head><body><h2>🛠️ Technical Implementation</h2>
<hr>
<h3>🎨 CSS Variable System</h3>
<p>Introduced CSS variables to manage color themes more effectively:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">:root {
  --placeholder-color: #6c757d;       /* Light mode */
  --input-bg-color: #dad6d9;
}

.dark-mode {
  --placeholder-color: #adb5bd;       /* Dark mode */
  --input-bg-color: #495057;
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h3>✏️ Placeholder Styling</h3>
<p>Improved placeholder visibility using scoped selectors and theme variables:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.form input::placeholder,
.form textarea::placeholder {
  color: var(--placeholder-color);
  opacity: 1;
  font-weight: bold;
}
</code></pre>
<p>🧹 <em>Also removed conflicting global placeholder rules to avoid override issues.</em></p>
<hr>
<h3>⬇️ Dropdown Enhancements</h3>
<p>Ensured dropdown <code inline="">&lt;select&gt;</code> and <code inline="">&lt;option&gt;</code> fields remain readable in dark mode:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.dark-mode .form select {
  color: white;
  background-color: var(--input-bg-color);
}

.dark-mode .form select option {
  background-color: #495057;
  color: white;
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h3>🎺 Typed Input Contrast</h3>
<p>Forced visibility for typed input content in dark mode:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.dark-mode .form input,
.dark-mode .form textarea {
  color: white !important;
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
